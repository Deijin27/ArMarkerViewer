# ArMarkerViewer

An app for viewing all of the valid AR Markers in Pokedex 3D Pro. 

The marker image is generated deterministically from the pokemon's ID.

Written in C#. The app itself uses WPF with ReactiveUI.

Change which marker is displayed in 3 different ways:
- Select from the list
- Type a ID number, or use the incrementers
- Interact directly with the image, enabling or disabling pixels
